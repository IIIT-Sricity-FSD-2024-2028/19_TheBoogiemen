**Problem Statement Description**

>> Traditional educational systems often suffer from the "Delayed Feedback" trap. In a standard classroom setting, a student takes an assessment, receives a numerical grade weeks later, and by then, the learning gap has already widened. The data collected is often superficial — a score of 7/10 tells a teacher that a student missed three questions, but it doesn't inherently explain why or which specific cognitive skill is lacking.

>> Our Edtech platform shifts the focus from simple "grade recording" to Data-Driven Education. The core problem this application solves is the lack of transparency in the learning journey. Instead of treating education as a series of isolated tests, our platform treats it as a continuous trajectory.

The application addresses:

1.) **Outcome Mapping**: Linking individual quiz questions or assignments to broad learning objectives (e.g., "Critical Thinking" or "Algebraic Logic") rather than just subject names.

2.) **The Feedback Loop**: Reducing the time between assessment and intervention by providing real-time monitoring.

3.) **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Balance**: Integrating teacher remarks and qualitative observations with raw scores to provide a holistic view of student health.



**Problem Statement Actors and their description**

>> **The Student**:
The student is the primary beneficiary of the data. Their interaction with the system is focused on self-regulation and actionable tasks. They move from being passive recipients of grades to active trackers of their own syllabus and research progress as well as attendance tracking.



>> **The Faculty**:
The professor is the primary data generator. Their role is to input raw performance data and transform it into instructional insights. They require tools that allow them to identify "at-risk" students quickly and manage the mentorship of advanced research projects.



>> **The Academic Head**:
The Academic Heads oversees the institutional integrity and logistics. They do not focus on individual learning gaps but rather on departmental performance, user provisioning, fee compliance, and the master academic calendar.






**Feature Description**

>> **Student Features**

1. **Performance Dashboard**: A visual interface to view marks, grades, and subject-wise performance history.

2. **Attendance Tracker**: Real-time view of attendance percentages with history logs to ensure compliance with institutional requirements.

3. **Outcome Heatmaps**: Visual charts showing strengths and weaknesses across different learning objectives.

4. **Syllabus & Task Tracker**: A personalized dashboard showing the percentage of course completion and status of pending assignments/quizzes.

5. **Leave Application System**: A workflow to apply for future lecture leaves, featuring a system check that warns students if the leave will drop their attendance below the mandatory threshold.

6. **Contextual Discussion Forum**: A forum where students can post queries tagged to specific Assignment IDs or topics for group discussion.

7. **Research Milestone Submission**: A dedicated portal for Honours/Research students to upload milestone documents (e.g., Literature Reviews) and track mentor approval.





>> **Teacher Features**

1. **Digital Gradebook**: Tools to add, update, and manage student marks with the ability to provide qualitative feedback.

2. **Lecture-Wise Attendance**: A streamlined interface to record daily attendance digitally, feeding directly into the student and admin dashboards.

3. **Outcome Mapping Engine**: Functionality to define specific "Learning Outcomes" for each topic and link them to assessment items.

4. **Class Analytics Dashboard**: A high-level view of class performance, comparing current batch averages against benchmarks.

5. **At-Risk Identification**: Automated flags for students showing low attendance or poor performance trends, allowing for early intervention.

6. **Mentorship Manager**: A system to review research milestones, provide feedback, and manage meeting availability for office hours.





>> **Academic Head Features**

1. **User & Role Management**: Global control over user accounts (Students, Teachers, Parents) and CSV-based bulk provisioning.

2. **Academic Structure Management**: Tools to create and manage classes, subjects, batches, and assign teachers to specific courses.

3. **Institutional Reporting**: Generation of aggregate academic and attendance reports for management review.

4. **Fee Compliance Tracker**: Monitoring fee payment status and triggering automated alerts for pending dues.

5. **Master Scheduler**: A centralized calendar to manage exams, guest lectures, and institutional events, ensuring no resource conflicts.

6. **Parent Report Generator**: A batch-processing tool to generate and distribute personalized progress reports to parents.
